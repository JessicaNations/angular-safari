      <p><b>Big Joel's Safari Petting Zoo and Educational Park is the "zoo made for you" and is the premier animal-based attraction in the area.</b></p>
      <p>Big Joel's is a family-owned farm and seasonal attraction.
        We opened the doors to our private menagerie to the public for the first time in July, 2012.
        Since then thousands of visitors have come to Big Joel's and they keep coming back for more.
        Big Joel and his family are continually improving and adding to their park every year (and sometimes during the year!).
        Come and see all types of animals from mild to wild.
        You can touch and feed many of our animal residents, and view the rest up close.
        Some of the animals you'll see include majestic bison, watusi cattle, zebu, aoudads, camels, zebras,
        llamas, african porcupines, ostriches, emus, parrots, reptiles, and a variety of deer, elk, and antelope as well as other farm animals.
        Big Joel's Safari now cares for well over 60 different animal species, both big and small!
        The great thing about Big Joel’s Safari is that you never know what you’ll see or learn on your next visit as there are always
        new-born animals, new species, exhibits, and things to do. Besides visiting with the local animal residents at the park,
        you can relax on our picnic benches under the pavilion, enjoy the scenery, shop or grab a snack in our gift shop.
        This is a family-oriented and educational experience you won't soon forget.
        So come on over for a change of pace away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
        Come and see what thousands of visitors are talking about.
        This is not your typical petting zoo and It's sure to be worth the trip, as we aim to make your experience a great one and the animals love the attention, too!

        Hope to see you then, Big Joel and MiMi

      <p><b>Established July, 2012</b></p>
        <p>The zoo and agri-tourism attraction is recognized by the Missouri Farm Bureau.
          We are a privately funded and licensed facility.
          We do not currently receive any government or donor support.
          Before opening the farm to the public, we had been
          working with and raising animals for many years.
          Many of the larger residents have been with us since they were only a few weeks old.
          One of the big camels, "Gus", and "Pumpkin" the bison cow, are some of the oldest residents.
          Joel has always had a passion for animals and got his first "exotic" pet,
          a ball python, when he was 6 years old.
          His passion for animals has only grown from there.
          He played college football for Mizzou and graduated with his degree in Animal Sciences in 2007.
          It was at Mizzou that he met his wife Melissa, "Mimi", who also shared
          a passion for animals. She almost went to school to be a veterinarian,
          but became an occupational therapists instead (don't worry Joel has
          forgiven her). Joel continued to play professional football for a few
          years after graduation and began to work more intensely with exotic
          animals during his off seasons. Not only at his own farm, but at larger
          facilities owned by close friends. Over the years we kept adding more animals. Friends and
          family enjoyed coming over to see the animals and as the word spread,
          many people would stop in the driveway to view the animals. It was
          from the encouragement of friends, that we began to plan opening a
          small animal park. Years of learning to care and handle different
          animals helped us create what it is today. Big Joel & Mimi
          are members of the ZAA (Zoological Association of America) and other
          organizations to help improve the animal's care. The farm keeps the whole Clinger family
          (mainly Joel's Parents) busy. Big Joel's
          Safari is still mainly run by Family and now with the help of friends.
          We are proud of the animals and of the
          family that have helped us create the one of a kind farm.
          We are always expanding and planning new projects.
          To keep up on new projects, animals, and news "Like" us on Facebook.
          Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about us,
          the farm, and of course, the animals. We hope to see you soon!

      Sincerely,
      Big Joel & Mimi
