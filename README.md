# EVENTS (maybe make this the dashboard)
* New and upcoming attractions
* If current month == month from range, display the holidays in the specified range.
## Counts the number of upcoming holidays to fetch:
* moment().nextHolidays(5).isHoliday();
## easy way
* display all dates for each holiday
* moment.holiday(Christmas);
* and format the date
## complicated way
* Create an array of each holiday to be displayed
* If holiday in date range is in the array, display it?
    * <container-element [ngSwitch]=”var now = moment().month()”>
    * <some-element *ngSwitchCase=”1”>  
    * moment().holidaysBetween(moment(‘1/1’ | ‘4/3’));
* etc
    * moment().holidaysBetween(moment(‘1/1’ | ‘4/3’));
    * moment().holidaysBetween(moment(‘2/1’ | ‘5/31’));
    * moment().holidaysBetween(moment(‘3/1’ | ‘6/30’));
    * moment().holidaysBetween(moment(‘4/1’ | ‘7/31’));
